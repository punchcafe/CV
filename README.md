## LUCA FRUZZA

I am a full stack developer.  I am an Astrophysics BSc graduate and went overseas to become a teacher and Team Leader in Japan.  This background has honed my logical, problem-solving skillset whilst balancing it with strong interpersonal skills; giving me a versatility which makes me an asset to any dev team.  Having discovered my calling to become a developer, I now want to apply these skills to the keyboard.  I’m eager for challenges which will drive me to learn and improve as a developer.

## Skills

With experience primarily using Python and Ruby to find solutions in  academic and professional scenarios, I’m now looking for opportunities which will push me to grow from a predominantly self-taught position into an industry professional standard developer.
